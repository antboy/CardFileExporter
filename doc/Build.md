## Building CardFileExporter
The source includes Visual Studio 2015 (VS2015) project files, so the simplest thing to do is load the project into VS2015 or later.

Download CardFileRdr.dll from [CardFileRdr](http://github.com/antboy/CardFileRdr) to the local build directory.  If using, for example, Visual Studio 2015, add the .dll as a reference to your project, otherwise link it in in the appropriate way for your build environment.
